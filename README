Roman Numerals provides an easy way of converting Roman numerals into more understandable year numbers and vice versa. Use it when you cannot quite work out the age of a building or to resolve disputes about the year in which a TV programme was made.

The current version is iPhone only, but there is a plan to make it work on the iPad with a specific 2-person mode along with in-app purchases that include a calculator and a sudoku game.
