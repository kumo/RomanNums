Roman Nums : Converter
======================

This is the code for a [Roman Numerals converter app](https://apps.apple.com/app/roman-nums-converter/id291773125) that was released in 2008 and that has been partially rewritten in Swift 3.

This code is mainly written in Objective-C with a storyboard, with some parts in Swift and SwiftUI.

This repo won't be updated and in-progress rewrite in SwiftUI can be found [here](https://github.com/kumo/RomanNums-SwiftUI) instead.
