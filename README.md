# Roman Nums : Converter

Roman Nums allows you to convert roman numerals. It also allows you to convert dates, and cheat at crossword puzzles, by searching for matching roman numerals.

## Installation

The easiest way is to download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/roman-nums-converter/id291773125).

Or, you can [download](https://github.com/kumo/RomanNums/tags) the source code, compile it with Xcode, and install it on your iOS device.

If you choose to build it yourself, you will need to change the developer identity.

## Notes

This app was initially written in Objective-C, and it has been partially rewritten in Swift and SwiftUI.
