Roman Numerals provides an easy way of converting Roman numerals into more understandable year numbers and vice versa. Use it when you cannot quite work out the age of a building or to resolve disputes about the year in which a TV programme was made.

To use it just choose whether you want to convert from Roman numerals or from Arabic numerals and then type in the year and the corresponding value will appear. There are preferences for enabling autocorrection and for choosing which order the roman numerals appear in on the keyboard.

Features:
- Roman <-> Arabic converter.
- easy to use Roman keyboard.
- automatically converts Roman Numerals (e.g. IIII -> IV) and ignores invalid ones.
- Roman Numerals can be shown in numerical or alphabetical order.
